## Software Interest
I hope to become a software engineer when I graduate college, and I have always enjoyed computer programming.

## Hope to Learn
I hope to learn how to write computer programs in various industry languages, as well as manage projects and meet client deadlines.
## Learn from Cybersecurity
In Cybersecurity, I want to learn how to use tools such as VIM and Powershell to create projects and work on them. I also want to learn various keyboard shortcuts to increase my speed.
## Other Hobbies
Other than computers, I enjoy hiking, playing tennis, shooting archery, and reading.
